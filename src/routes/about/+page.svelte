    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What is the Enneagram?</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      The Enneagram is a powerful system of personality typing that describes nine fundamental personality types and their complex interrelationships. The word "Enneagram" comes from the Greek words "ennea" (nine) and "grammos" (a written symbol), and refers to the nine-pointed symbol used to represent the system.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Unlike many personality typing systems, the Enneagram doesn't just describe behavior but delves deeper into the motivations, fears, and desires that drive our actions. It helps us understand not just what we do, but why we do it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Each of the nine types has a distinct worldview and set of motivations that influence how they interpret events and interact with others. The Enneagram also recognizes that people are dynamic and can express different aspects of their personality in different contexts or at different times in their lives.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">History of the Enneagram</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      The modern Enneagram of Personality has diverse roots, drawing from ancient wisdom traditions, mystical Christianity, Sufism, and modern psychology. While the symbol itself has ancient origins, the contemporary understanding of the nine personality types began to take shape in the 20th century.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Oscar Ichazo is credited with connecting the ancient symbol to specific personality types in the 1950s and 1960s. His work was further developed by Claudio Naranjo, a psychiatrist who integrated modern psychological concepts with Ichazo's original ideas.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In the 1970s, the Enneagram was introduced to the United States, where it has continued to evolve through the contributions of authors and teachers like Don Richard Riso, Russ Hudson, Helen Palmer, and others who have expanded and refined the system.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">About Our Quiz</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Our Enneagram quiz is designed to help you identify your primary Enneagram type through a series of carefully crafted questions that reflect the core motivations and patterns of each type.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      While no quiz can perfectly determine your type (self-reflection and learning about the system are essential parts of the process), our assessment provides a solid starting point for your Enneagram journey.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      The quiz measures your responses across all nine types and identifies which patterns most strongly resonate with you. It also identifies your potential "wing" or secondary influence from an adjacent type.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Remember that the goal of learning your Enneagram type is not to box yourself in, but to gain self-awareness that can lead to personal growth and better relationships with others.
